Sprint 1.
Already scored.

Sprint 2.
Aready scored.

Sprint 3.
I am working regularly, My teammate is stuck with hosting on heroku.

I use a white board with blue marker at my home to plan the Sprint

The documentation to run is simple. Clone the repo, install node, run serve -l 8080 (create react app).

yashtibrewal.in is the hosted.

There is no need for test cases as of now. Every visit to the website is a test case. If there is a bug, please raise the issue.


Sprint 4.

Project Submission (As per Guidelines mentioned on canvas)
1. I am making my portfolio website to showcase my recruiters. This eradicates the one pager resumes which always are never enough to show the recruiter what truely the student is capable of. Implementing a portfolio website is as good as creating a website for a company.
2. Video is not required as scrolling on the website is a video itself.
3. I have not used cypress because there was no need.
4. I have worked alone and chose frontend as the main technology, however if time permits, I would implement a backend logic before the sprint ends.
5. There are no APIs created as of now.
6. https://github.com/users/yashtibrewal/projects/1 Since I switched projects, the link to project board is of my previous work which includes backend logic implemented in GOLang.
7. https://github.com/yashtibrewal All the commits made during the Sprint 4 timeline are considered to be Sprint4 deliverables.
8. Frontend: Yash Tibrewal (yashtibrewal@ufl.edu) 
9. http://www.yashtibrewal.in deployed on AWS EC2 Instance. Domain purchased from bookyour.in (cheapest domains)
10. I am willing to work on this project till I land a job.

Bonus: https://yashtibrewal.github.io/portfolio-website/

In case there are any issues, please email me. I hope the grading is fair.
