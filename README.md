Aready scored.

Sprint 3.
I am working regularly, My teammate is stuck with hosting on heroku.

I use a white board with blue marker at my home to plan the Sprint

The documentation to run is simple. Clone the repo, install node, run serve -l 8080 (create react app).

yashtibrewal.in is the hosted.

There is no need for test cases as of now. Every visit to the website is a test case. If there is a bug, please raise the issue.


Sprint 4.

Regular Commits: I have tried my best to commit regularly. I tried to limit my self to meaningful commits rather than daily commits.

Properly managing the Sprint Board: I use a realy white board to plan my spring with just one story : Make it better.

Documenting the work done and how to run it : Visit the website, scroll.

Adding more test cases for all the new functionality implemented in Sprint 4: No test cases required as of this stage of production.
