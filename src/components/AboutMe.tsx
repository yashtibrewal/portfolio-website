            <br />
            <div><br />I am currently pursuing a <b>graduate degree in computer science</b> at the University of Florida, Gainesville. Over the course of my academic journey, I have gained valuable knowledge and practical experience in various domains of <b>software development</b>. With two years of professional experience, I have gained skills in <b>Android development, frontend and backend development, database management, website design (UI/UX), and machine learning. </b></div>
            <div><br />During my undergraduate studies, I actively sought opportunities to participate in competitions and hackathons, showcasing my enthusiasm and passion for the field. I engaged in two significant projects spanning six months each, both focusing on machine learning. The first project involved <b>image processing</b> for fraud detection and healthcare applications, conducted in collaboration with Mastek. This experience allowed me to tackle real-world challenges while leveraging machine learning techniques. </div>
            <div><br />In my final year of undergraduate studies, I embarked on a project centered around <b>natural language processing (NLP)</b>. This project aimed to implement sentiment analysis within the domain of politics, offering hands-on experience in NLP techniques and text analytics. Simultaneously, I consistently pursued workshops and training sessions, exploring diverse topics such as robotics. Additionally, I participated in multiple <b>hackathons</b>, which provided invaluable insights into different problem-solving approaches. </div>
            <div><br />Professionally, my career began during my undergraduate years with an internship at IIFL Finance, a multinational corporation. As an <b>Android Developer Intern</b>, I contributed to the creation of a native Android application. The application served as a versatile module across various pages and apps within the company. My manager was impressed with my work, encouraged me to apply for a full-time role. However, I decided to continue pursuing my studies. </div>
            <div><br />Following the completion of my bachelor's degree, I explored <b>freelance opportunities</b>, utilizing my expertise in web design to create static websites for clients. Notably, I collaborated with NueralTechSoft, where I gained hands on in <b>Python</b> and applied it to analyze data in stock markets. </div>
            <div><br />Amidst the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I secured a position as a technical intern at Stylabs. Initially focused on <b>backend technologies</b>, I took the initiative to expand my role by incorporating <b>frontend development tasks</b>. Within five months, my dedication and contributions led to a promotion as a <b>junior full-stack developer</b>. This achievement was particularly significant considering the high layoff rate during the pandemic. </div>
            <div><br />Motivated to continue my academic pursuits, I applied to several universities for a master's degree in computer science. Eventually, I received acceptance letters from prominent institutions such as the Uni. of California (Irvine), Northeastern Uni. (MA), the Uni. of Florida (GNV, FL), and Syracuse Uni. (NY). After considering the circumstances, I chose to join the University of Florida (UF) and continued my journey as a Gator, beginning my master's program. </div>
            <div><br />During my master's studies, I have been exposed to a wide range of new concepts and technologies through various courses. Engaging in mini-projects allowed me to apply these newly acquired skills and gain practical experience. I also experienced cultural differences and diverse teaching approaches, as studying in the United States provided a different educational environment compared to my earlier studies in India. </div>
            <div><br />Among the numerous courses I pursued, one of my favorites was Software Verification. This course introduced an intriguing approach suggesting that software could be verified without need for testing. I engaged in research work focused on advanced computer networking. This experience allowed me to dig deeper into the existing technologies. Furthermore, I ventured outside my comfort zone by enrolling in an entrepreneurship course. This course provided valuable insights and instilled an entrepreneurial mindset within me. </div>
            <div><br />To further fuel my passion for machine learning, I opted for subjects that incorporated hands-on coding using machine learning libraries. This practical exposure enabled me to apply algorithms and develop predictive models, enhancing my proficiency in the field. </div>
            <div><br />Throughout my academic journey, I cultivated an interest in extracurricular activities as well. Initially exploring sports like lawn tennis, I eventually found my passion for chess, and swimming. Recognizing its strategic nature and intellectual stimulation, I actively pursued chess and even participated in rated tournaments during my college. </div>
            <div><br />While pursuing my master's degree, I continued to nurture my interest in <b>chess</b>. Participating in rated tournaments within the college circuit allowed me to challenge myself against skilled opponents. A truly memorable experience was getting the opportunity to meet and play against Sam Shankland. Even after the event, he remembered the moves I played, leaving me shocked. </div>
            <div><br />As I approach the completion of my master's program, with just one semester and one course remaining, I eagerly anticipate commencing my professional career in the United States. Fueled my passion for learning, my curiosity to explore new technologies, and my drive to go the extra mile, I aspire to contribute my skills to a company, making processes more efficient, creating innovative solutions, and embarking on a fulfilling career journey. I am excited to leverage my knowledge and skills as I embark on a successful career in the field of computer science. </div>
